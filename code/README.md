# Technigo React Starter App

In this assignment, I'm starting to use react states by implementing a positive twitter connected with API in this second version you can explore between create a user and log in with an existing user. 

## Usage

In the app, you can send thoughts, hashtags,  get an error when the text is too short or long, identify new messages, and add like to different posts.

also, you can explore between more used hashtags and do a logout of the app.
